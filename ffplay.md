# ffplay

## Linux notice

The binary source we are using for Linux (https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/) doesn't come with **ffplay**. If this is a problem you've just hit, you can still install this binary globally, make sure its available in your platform's PATH environment variable, and plugin will pick it up automatically.

Or alternatively, if you know about a better source we can switch to, please post it in [@drovp/ffmpeg#1](https://github.com/drovp/ffmpeg/issues/1).
