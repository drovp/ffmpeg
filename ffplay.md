# ffplay

## Linux notice

The binary source we are using for Linux (https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/) doesn't come with **ffplay**. If this is a problem you've just hit, you can still install this binary globally, and plugin will pick it up automatically.

Or alternatively, if yo uknow about a better source we can switch to, please post it in [@drovp/ffmpeg#1](https://github.com/drovp/ffmpeg/issues/1).
